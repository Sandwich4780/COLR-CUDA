# COLR-CUDA
Computation Oriented Library for Rendering (COLR) will be a very basic 3d graphics library/program.
I'm doing this to get a better understanding of GPUs, parallel computation, and computer graphics, so don't expect it to be amazing.
As with Photon, this is just a personal project that will probably only work on my pc :) and will take a long time to develop because I only code when I want to.
